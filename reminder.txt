[Reminder to myself]


Probably:
I'm not setting carry flag correctly in SBB and ADC.  In case Carry+Op2==0x100000000, the prev and new values are equal, but it goes exactly one round.

Clocks for RCL/RCR
For REG it should be 8-30, for MEM it should be 9-31.
But how to calculate is nowhere to find.
For now temporarilyl I make it 10 for everything.

Stack Addressing Size
In the explanation of PUSH instructions, [1] mentions about stack addressing size.  I cannot find the same description anywhere else.  In one location I read default operand size and default addressing size depends on the D bit of CS in the protected mode, or always 16 in the real mode.  What defines stack addressing size?  Is it D bit of SS?

Correct in i486.cpp:

unsigned int i486DX::GetStackAddressingSize(void) const

When what exactly stack addressing size is.
