[Reminder to myself]


Probably:
I'm not setting carry flag correctly in SBB and ADC.  In case Carry+Op2==0x100000000, the prev and new values are equal, but it goes exactly one round.



#20200123-1
Clocks for RCL/RCR
For REG it should be 8-30, for MEM it should be 9-31.
But how to calculate is nowhere to find.
For now temporarilyl I make it 10 for everything.
